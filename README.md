psutils
=======

A collection of command line utilities written in Powershell, proudly ignoring Powershell Verb-Noun naming conventions.

These are designed to be installed with [Scoop](http://scoop.sh).

* *ln* - An approximation of the Unix `ln` command.
* *runat* - A replacement for the `at` command which Microsoft has deprecated and removed in Windows 2012.
* *say* - An approximation of [`say`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/say.1.html) from Mac OS X.
* *shasum* - An approximation of [shasum](http://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum).
* *sudo* - An approximation of the Unix `sudo` command. Shows a UAC popup window unfortunately.
* *time* - An approximation of the Unix `time` command.
* *touch* - A port of the Unix `touch` command.
* *vimtutor* - The `vimtutor` that comes with Vim for Windows doesn't work with Scoop. This one does.
